# `Heaven's Door` üìù

[Todo.txt](#format) support for [notes.io](https://notes.io/).

## Rationale

I've relied on [notes.io](https://notes.io/) for [offloading](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-019-0201-4) and jotting down quick [snippets](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/snippet) for longer than I can remember.

In particular, I prized it for its simplicity, ease of use and lack of unnecessary distractions. Really, I only ever had three gripes with [notes.io](https://notes.io/).

1. No textual formatting support.
2. Lack of color themes.
3. Accidentally closing the [notes.io](https://notes.io/) tab would cause all content to be lost.

With these considerations in mind, I created [Heaven's Door](https://github.com/gongahkia/heavens-door), a locally-hosted, buffer-secure, themed notepad with first-class [Todo.txt](#format) support that can be called from the terminal.  
  
To save you from those pesky slipups, [Heaven's Door](https://github.com/gongahkia/heavens-door) also automatically saves its contents to your clipboard upon tab closure.
